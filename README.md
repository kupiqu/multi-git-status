Multi-git-status
================

Show uncommited, untracked and unpushed changes in multiple Git repositories.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fboender/multi-git-status/master/screenshot.png)

multi-git-status shows:

* **Needs push(BRANCH)** if the branch is tracking a remote branch which is
  behind. If there are branches with no remote, this status is also shown
  since the branch might be new and unpushed. This is even true for branches
  with no new commits.
* **Needs pull(BRANCH)** if the branch is tracking a remote branch which is
  ahead. This requires that the local git repo already knows about the remote
  changes (i.e. you've done a `fetch`). It does NOT contact the remote.
* **Uncomitted changes** if there are unstaged or uncommitted changes on the
  checked out branch.
* **Untracked files** if there are untracked files which are not ignored.

Since there are a lot of different states a git repository can be in,
multi-git-status makes no guarantees that *all* states are taken into account.
For example, multi-git-status does not look at stashes.

multi-git-status can also list dirs that are not a repo, if given the `-w`
switch.


# Usage

    Usage: mgitstatus [-w] [DIR] [DEPTH=2]

    Scan for .git dirs and show git status

    If no argument is given, it uses 'locate' command

    Otherwise it uses 'find' command under 'DIR' (up to 'DEPTH' dirs deep)

    In such case, '-w' warns about dirs that are not Git repositories


The following example scans all directories under the current dir, with a
depth of 2. That means the current dir and all directories directly under it.

    ~/Projects/fboender $ mgitstatus
    ./multi-git-status: ok
    ./mdpreview: ok
    ./snippets: ok
    ./boxes: ok
    ./ansible-cmdb: Uncommitted changes Untracked files
    ./scriptform: Uncommitted changes

To scan deeper:

    ~/Projects $ mgitstatus . 3
    ./megacorp/ansible: ok
    ./megacorp/monitoring: ok
    ./fboender/multi-git-status: ok
    ./fboender/mdpreview: ok
    ./fboender/snippets: ok
    ./fboender/boxes: ok
    ./fboender/ansible-cmdb: Uncommitted changes Untracked files
    ./fboender/scriptform: Uncommitted changes
    ./fboender/startpage: ok
